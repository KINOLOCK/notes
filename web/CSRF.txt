Malicious person carries out their attack by making posts
on websites and social media that contain an image link that looks like this:

<img src="http://www.mystore.com/buy?item=expensiveThing"/>
 
Now imagine a customer who is logged into your site, 
who is visiting one of the pages where this link has been placed.

When their browser encounters this tag it will automatically makes a GET request
to the URL (because it naively wants to show the picture to your customer).
When it does this, it automatically sends along the cookies for www.mystore.com with the request.

Thus, the server thinks your customer is logged in and completes the 1-click purchase for the customer!

a da je bio token neki u HTTP hederu, ne bi radilo,
jer njegova stranica ga nema :)
