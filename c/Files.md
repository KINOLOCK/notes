Files in Linux are not only "physical files" but also sockets, pipes, devices, terminals...  
They're unified under a unique abstraction called "file.

Every program inherits 3 basic file descriptors:
- stdin, standard input (Console input)
- stdout, standard output (Console output)
- stderr, statndard error (Console error)

When you open a file you get a "file descriptor".
